### Project Description
Campus Community Hub

### The Problem statement
College students frequently lose personal belongings, struggle to find resources to borrow or lend, and face difficulty in finding companions for various activities. These issues lead to inconvenience, wasted time, and missed opportunities for collaboration within the campus community.


### The Solution
Amica provides a digital campus community hub where students can:
1. Report & find lost items seamlessly.
2. Lend & borrow books, gadgets, and other items securely.
3. Connect with companions for shared activities like studying, travel, or sports.
The platform will ensure easy navigation, verified listings, and an intuitive user experience, making campus life more convenient, interactive, and collaborative.
